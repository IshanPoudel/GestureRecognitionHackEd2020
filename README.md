Demo Video: https://youtu.be/yUPsvvMsgsA

Have you ever wondered what it's like to be in the mind of a programming prodigy? 
We don't, but we do adore the Google Dinosaur Game. 

A couple of years ago, voice-controlled jumping games took the internet by storm. However, we wanted to make a fun gesture-controlled game for people with speech disabilities (and of course people who don't like screaming). So we made the ClenchRex. 

ClenchRex is a program that helps you play the Google Dinosaur Game by using hand gestures. Use ClenchRex to exercise your hands in a fun way! Clenching fists actually helps improve memory, it makes you feel better and is also known to boost confidence. This Gesture-Control Assistant for the Google Dinosaur Game comes with a lot of benefits, and most importantly - it's hella fun! 

How to play: 

0. Download ClenchRex.py from GitHub Repository 
1. Open Google Dinosaur Game on Chrome 
2. Run the Python Program 
3. Put your clenched fist in the Green Box, and start the game.
4. Open your fist to Jump, clench back again to stop Jumping. 

Install on Linux:

`pip3 install opencv-python`
